            Companies sell shares in their business to raise money. They then use that money for various initiatives: A company might use money raised from a stock offering to fund new products or product lines, to invest in growth, to expand their operations or to pay off debt.
            Companies typically begin to issue shares in their stock through a process called an initial public offering, or IPO. Once a company’s stock is on the market, it can be bought and sold among investors. If you decide to buy a stock, you’ll often buy it not from the company itself, but from another investor who wants to sell the stock. Likewise, if you want to sell a stock, you’ll sell to another investor who wants to buy.
            These trades are handled through a stock exchange, with a broker representing each investor. Many investors these days use online stockbrokers, buying and selling stocks through the broker’s trading platform, which connects them to exchanges. If you don’t have a brokerage account, you’ll need one to buy stocks.
            Most investors own what’s called common stock, which is what is described above. Common stock comes with voting rights, and may pay investors dividends. There are other kinds of stocks, including preferred stocks, which work a bit differently.
            But while stocks overall have a history of high returns, they also come with risk: It’s entirely possible that a stock in your portfolio will go down in value instead. Stock prices fluctuate for a variety of reasons, from overall market volatility to company-specific events, like a communications crisis or a product recall.
            Many long-term investors hold on to stocks for years, without frequent buying or selling, and while they see those stocks fluctuate over time, their overall portfolio goes up in value over the long term. These investors often own stocks through mutual funds or index funds, which pool many investments together.
